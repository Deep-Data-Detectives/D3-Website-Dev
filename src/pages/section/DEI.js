<p><strong>DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Deep Data Detectives (D3), a diverse, inclusive, and equitable initiative is one where all volunteers, staff, board of directors, partners and vendors, whatever their gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or disability, feel valued and respected. We are committed to a nondiscriminatory approach and provide equal opportunity for employment and advancement in all of our departments, programs, and worksites. We respect and value diverse life experiences and heritages and ensure that all voices are valued and heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re committed to modeling diversity and inclusion for the entire arts industry of the nonprofit sector, and to maintaining an inclusive environment with equitable treatment for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide informed, authentic leadership for cultural equity, NWF strives to:</p>
<ul className="ullist1">
<li>See diversity, inclusion, and equity as connected to our mission and critical to ensure the well-being of our staff and the arts communities we serve.</li>
<li>Acknowledge and dismantle any inequities within our policies, systems, programs, and services, and continually update and report organization progress.</li>
<li>Explore potential underlying, unquestioned assumptions that interfere with inclusiveness.</li>
<li>Advocate for and support board-level thinking about how systemic inequities impact our organization&rsquo;s work, and how best to address that in a way that is consistent with our mission.</li>
<li>Help to challenge assumptions about what it takes to be a strong leader at our organization, and who is well-positioned to provide leadership.</li>
<li>Practice and encourage transparent communication in all interactions.</li>
<li>Commit time and resources to expand more diverse leadership within our board, staff, committee, and advisory bodies.</li>
<li>Lead with respect and tolerance. We expect all volunteers to embrace this notion and to express it in workplace interactions and through everyday practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-Creation Nation abides by the following action items to help promote diversity and inclusion in our workplace:</p>
<ul className="ullist1">
<li>Pursue cultural competency throughout our organization by creating substantive learning opportunities and formal, transparent policies.</li>
<li>Generate and aggregate quantitative and qualitative research related to equity to make incremental, measurable progress toward the visibility of our diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts. Once the content is curated it will be added to our website so others can access.</li>
<li>Improve our cultural leadership pipeline by creating and supporting programs and policies that foster leadership that reflects the diversity of American society.</li>
<li>Pool resources and expand offerings for underrepresented constituents by connecting with other arts organizations committed to diversity and inclusion efforts.</li>
<li>Develop and present sessions on diversity, inclusion, and equity to provide information and resources internally, and to members, the community, and the arts industry.</li>
<li>Develop a system for being more intentional and conscious of bias during the hiring, promoting, or evaluating process. Train our hiring team on equitable practices.</li>
<li>Include a salary range with all public job descriptions.</li>
<li>Advocate for public and private-sector policy that promotes diversity, inclusion, and equity. Challenge systems and policies that create inequality, oppression and disparity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are committed to improving Co-Creation Nation&rsquo;s Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Policy in an effort upholding our values and standards:</p>
<ul className="ullist1">
<li>Including our Diversity, Inclusion and Equality policy in our hiring, onboarding, and orientation processes for new volunteers, board members, committee members, and eventually employees in the near future.</li>
<li>Weave the policy into our organization&rsquo;s strategic plan.</li>
<li>Implement a zero tolerance policy for bullying and harassment.</li>
<li>Open up a conversation with employees and volunteers about what diversity, inclusion, and equity mean to them. This will help our employees feel heard and included, and their insight will help you judge your policy. Conduct monthly, quarterly, or annual check-ins with employees to see how they perceive your efforts are faring.</li>
<li>Form a diversity committee to keep a pulse on tactics and goals and pivot when necessary.</li>
</ul>
